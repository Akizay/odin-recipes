This is my first project in The Odin Project. I already know some HTML and CSS, but I want to formalize my understanding with this course and grow my knowledge even further.

With this recipes project, I will demostrate my mastery of basic HTML skills (create a boilerplate by memory, use <head> and <body> tags, and use other basic HTML tags to create a barebones website).
